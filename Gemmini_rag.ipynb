It has thrived under the glow of cultural splendor and suffered under the ravages of war. The\\nterritory now constituting Bangladesh was under the Muslim rule over five and a half centuries from 1201\\nto 1757 A.D. Then it was ruled by the British, after the defeat of the last sovereign ruler of Bengal, Nawab\\nSiraj ud-Daulah, at the Battle of Plassey on the fateful day of June 23, 1757. The British ruled over the\\nentire Indian sub-continent including this territory for nearly 190 years from 1757 to 1947. During that\\nperiod Bangladesh was a part of the British Indian provinces of Bengal and Assam. With the termination\\nof the British rule in August, 1947 the sub-continent was partitioned into India and Pakistan. Bangladesh\\nthen became a part of Pakistan and was named as East Pakistan. It remained so far about 24 years from\\nAugust 14, 1947 to March 25, 1971. It appeared on the world map as an independent and sovereign\\nstate named Bangladesh on December 16, 1971 following victory at the War of Liberation (from March\\n25 to December 16, 1971).\\nGeographical Bangladesh lies in the north eastern part of South Asia between 20o34' and 26 o 38' north latitude\\nand 88 o 01' and 92 o 41' east longitude. The country is bounded by India on the west-north and north-\\neast while Myanmar on the south-east and the Bay of Bengal on the south. The area of the country is\\n56,977 sq. miles or 1, 47,570 sq. k.m. The limits of territorial water area of Bangladesh are 12 nautical\\nmiles and the area of the high seas extending to 200 nautical miles measured from the base lines\\nconstitutes the economic zone of the country. Bangladesh won in Arbitral Tribunal/PCA more than 1,\\n18,813 square kilometers of waters comprising territorial sea, exclusive economic zone extending out to\\n200 NM across sizable area, and also has undeniable sovereign rights in the sea bed extending as far as\\n354 NM from Chattogram coast in the Bay of Bengal with all the living and non living resources. To\\nachieve an equitable result, the tribunal awarded Bangladesh 19,467sq km of area out of total disputed\\narea of 25,602 sq km (approx).\\nPhysiography Except the hilly regions in the north-east, south-east and some areas of high land in the northern\\npart, the country consists of plain and fertile land. A network of rivers exists in the country of which the\\nPadma, the Jamuna, the Teesta, the Brahmaputra, the Surma, the Meghna and the Karnaphuli are\\nprominent. All those rivers have 230 tributaries with a total length of about 24140 kilometers. The alluvial\\nsoil is thus continuously being enriched by heavy silts deposited by rivers during the rainy season.\\nFlora and Fauna Of the total area of Bangladesh, forest lands account for almost 21.05% of its geographical surface.\\nThe total forest land includes classified and unclassified state lands and homestead forests and\\ntea/rubber gardens. The Sundarban is the largest mangrove forest in the world. It lies at the southern\\npart of the Ganges delta and is spread across the coastal areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal of India.\\nThe section of Sundarban that belongs to Bangladesh has been listed in the UNESCO world heritage.\\nThe Sundarban is known for its wide range of fauna. Sundarban is the home of the world famous 'Royal\\nBengal Tiger'. Numerous species of birds, spotted deer, crocodiles and snakes also inhabit there. The\\ncountry produces timber, bamboo and cane. Bamboos grow in almost all areas but quality timber grows\\nmostly in the hilly region of country. Among the timber sal, gamari, chaplish, telsu\\x00, jarul, teak, garjan\\nand sundari are valuably important. Plantation of rubber in the hilly regions of the country was\\nundertaken and extraction of rubber had already been started.\"),\n",
